<div class="container">
    <section>
        <h2>1. Policy Framework</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Purpose and Scope:</strong> Define the purpose of the BCP, its objectives, and the scope of the policy. Explain what the BCP covers, such as critical functions, assets, and stakeholders.</li>
            <li><strong>Leadership and Responsibility:</strong> Identify the leadership team, including the Business Continuity Manager and other key personnel responsible for planning, implementation, and maintenance.</li>
            <li><strong>Governance Structure:</strong> Outline the organizational structure that will support the BCP, including departments, roles, and responsibilities.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>2. Risk Assessment and Business Impact Analysis (BIA)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Risk Assessment:</strong> Identify potential threats (e.g., natural disasters, cyberattacks, power failures) and vulnerabilities that could impact business operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Business Impact Analysis (BIA):</strong> Identify critical business functions and processes. Determine the potential impact of disruptions on these functions, including financial, operational, and reputational effects.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>3. Recovery Objectives and Strategies</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Recovery Time Objectives (RTO):</strong> Define the maximum acceptable downtime for critical systems and processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery Point Objectives (RPO):</strong> Define the maximum acceptable data loss in terms of time (how much data can be lost before the business operation is significantly impacted).</li>
            <li><strong>Business Continuity Strategies:</strong> Develop strategies for maintaining or quickly restoring critical functions. This may include cloud backups, disaster recovery sites, or manual processes.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>4. Communication Plan</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Internal Communication:</strong> Outline how information will be communicated within the organization during an emergency, including escalation procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>External Communication:</strong> Define how the organization will communicate with external stakeholders (e.g., customers, suppliers, regulators) in the event of a disruption.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>5. Incident Response and Recovery Procedures</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Incident Identification and Notification:</strong> Establish clear procedures for identifying and reporting incidents.</li>
            <li><strong>Response Procedures:</strong> Define the steps to take immediately after an incident is detected, such as activating the BCP, notifying relevant stakeholders, and containing the impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Recovery Procedures:</strong> Outline how the business will recover from the incident, including restoring systems, processes, and communications.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>6. Training and Awareness</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Staff Training:</strong> Develop a training program for employees at all levels to ensure they understand their roles in the BCP and know what to do during an incident.</li>
            <li><strong>Simulations and Drills:</strong> Regularly conduct simulations and testing of the BCP to ensure its effectiveness. This could involve tabletop exercises or full-scale drills.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>7. Testing, Maintenance, and Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Testing the BCP:</strong> Regularly test the BCP through exercises, such as disaster recovery testing, to validate the effectiveness of recovery procedures.</li>
            <li><strong>Updating the BCP:</strong> Periodically review and update the policy to ensure it reflects changes in the business environment, technology, and regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li><strong>Lessons Learned and Continuous Improvement:</strong> After each test or real incident, conduct a post-mortem analysis to identify areas for improvement and implement changes as necessary.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>8. Documentation and Reporting</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>BCP Documentation:</strong> Keep detailed and up-to-date records of all BCP procedures, recovery plans, and contact lists.</li>
            <li><strong>Reporting:</strong> Establish reporting requirements for both internal and external stakeholders. This may include regular reports on BCP readiness, issues encountered during tests, and post-incident evaluations.</li>
        </ul>
