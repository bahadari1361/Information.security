    <h2>Access Control</h2>
    <p>At the <strong>Central Bank of Afghanistan</strong>, ensuring the security and integrity of critical financial infrastructure was my top priority. One of the key areas I focused on was <strong>Access Control</strong>, where I implemented robust systems to safeguard sensitive data and applications.</p>

    <h3>Key Practices Implemented:</h3>

    <h4>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):</h4>
    <p>During my tenure, I spearheaded the implementation of <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> across all systems, applications, and critical financial platforms. By integrating MFA, I ensured that access was not solely dependent on passwords, thereby mitigating the risk of unauthorized access even if credentials were compromised. This approach added an extra layer of security, particularly in a high-stakes environment like banking, where the threat of cyber-attacks is constant.</p>

    <h4>Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP):</h4>
    <p>I introduced the <strong>Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)</strong> within the bank’s access management framework, which restricted user permissions to only what was necessary for their specific roles. This policy minimized the attack surface by reducing the number of privileged accounts and access to sensitive systems. Regular audits were conducted to ensure that users’ permissions were always aligned with their roles, and unnecessary access was revoked immediately.</p>

    <h4>Access Auditing and Monitoring:</h4>
    <p>To ensure ongoing security, I implemented comprehensive <strong>access auditing</strong> and <strong>monitoring</strong> procedures. By continuously tracking who accessed what resources, I was able to detect and respond to suspicious activity in real-time. The ability to review access logs helped maintain strict accountability and ensured compliance with both internal policies and external regulations.</p>

    <h3>Why It Matters:</h3>
    <p>At the <strong>Central Bank of Afghanistan</strong>, where safeguarding financial assets is crucial, implementing strong access control mechanisms was essential to protect against both internal and external threats. <strong>MFA</strong> and <strong>PoLP</strong> have been instrumental in mitigating risks such as credential theft, insider threats, and privilege escalation attacks, helping maintain the bank’s operational integrity and compliance with global security standards.</p>
