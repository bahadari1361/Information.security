        <section class="section">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Red and Blue Team exercises are crucial in testing and enhancing the security defenses of an organization. As an Information Security Manager, I coordinated and facilitated multiple Red and Blue Team exercises to simulate realistic cyber-attacks and improve our security posture. These exercises focused on identifying weaknesses, testing our incident response capabilities, and improving threat detection techniques.</p>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Objective and Goals</h2>
            <h3>Red Team</h3>
            <p>The goal of the Red Team was to emulate real-world attackers using a variety of techniques and tools to breach our defenses. The objectives included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Penetrating the network using external and internal attack vectors</li>
                <li>Escalating privileges to gain unauthorized access</li>
                <li>Simulating social engineering attacks, including phishing campaigns</li>
                <li>Exfiltrating sensitive data or compromising critical systems</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Blue Team</h3>
            <p>The Blue Team's mission was to defend against the attacks initiated by the Red Team, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detecting and responding to real-time attacks using monitoring tools</li>
                <li>Implementing incident response procedures and containment strategies</li>
                <li>Mitigating threats through security controls such as firewalls, IDS/IPS, and endpoint protection</li>
                <li>Improving overall detection and response capabilities</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Tools and Technologies Used</h2>
            <h3>Red Team Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Metasploit Framework</li>
                <li>Cobalt Strike</li>
                <li>Burp Suite</li>
                <li>Social Engineering (Phishing)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Blue Team Tools</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>SIEM (Splunk, ELK)</li>
                <li>Intrusion Detection Systems (Suricata, Snort)</li>
                <li>Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</li>
                <li>Firewall (Palo Alto, Fortinet)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Exercise Details</h2>
            <h3>Red Team Scenarios</h3>
            <p>The Red Team executed a variety of tactics to test the defenses:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>External network penetration using SQL Injection vulnerabilities</li>
                <li>Privilege escalation on internal systems using misconfigured user privileges</li>
                <li>Phishing emails to target internal employees and collect sensitive information</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Blue Team Response</h3>
            <p>The Blue Team responded to these attacks with the following countermeasures:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detected unauthorized access via SIEM and triggered automated alerts</li>
                <li>Blocked phishing emails using email filtering tools and user training</li>
                <li>Isolated compromised systems and initiated incident response protocols</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>Key Findings and Results</h2>
            <p>Several vulnerabilities were uncovered during the exercise, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Inadequate monitoring of critical infrastructure</li>
                <li>Lack of multi-factor authentication in several key systems</li>
                <li>Slow response times in identifying compromised accounts</li>
