    <h1>Portfolio Project: Information Security Management at the Central Bank of Afghanistan</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        As the Information Security Manager at the Central Bank of Afghanistan, I was responsible for designing,
        implementing, and managing a comprehensive set of security measures to protect the bank’s sensitive data,
        networks, and IT infrastructure. This portfolio outlines my work in developing security policies, business 
        continuity plans, incident response strategies, conducting IT audits, penetration testing, and security 
        assessments to ensure the organization’s resilience against evolving cyber threats. Additionally, I played a key 
        role in the deployment of ISO 27001 to align the bank's security framework with international best practices.

        management procedures.
