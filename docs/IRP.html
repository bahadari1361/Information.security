        </div>

        <div id="team" class="panel">
            <h2>Incident Response Team (IRT)</h2>
            <p>An effective IRP requires a dedicated team with defined roles:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Incident Response Manager (IRM)</li>
                <li>Technical Leads</li>
                <li>Legal Advisors</li>
                <li>Communication Leads</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each role is responsible for specific tasks to ensure a coordinated and timely response to the incident.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="detection" class="panel">
            <h2>Incident Detection and Reporting</h2>
            <p>Security Monitoring: Leveraging SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) systems, intrusion detection systems (IDS), and endpoint protection to detect incidents in real-time.</p>
            <p>Incident Reporting: A system for staff to report incidents or anomalies quickly and efficiently, ensuring rapid escalation.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="containment" class="panel">
            <h2>Containment and Mitigation Strategies</h2>
            <p>Short-Term Containment: Isolating affected systems to prevent further damage.</p>
            <p>Long-Term Containment: Implementing long-term fixes to prevent the incident from reoccurring.</p>
            <p>Data Protection: Ensuring that evidence and data integrity are maintained throughout the response.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="eradication" class="panel">
            <h2>Eradication and Recovery</h2>
            <p>Eradication: Identifying the root cause of the incident and eliminating all traces of the threat.</p>
            <p>System Recovery: Restoring systems to a secure, operational state while ensuring no vulnerabilities remain.</p>
            <p>Post-Incident Monitoring: After recovery, continuous monitoring is essential to ensure no residual threat persists.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="review" class="panel">
            <h2>Post-Incident Review</h2>
            <p>Root Cause Analysis: Examining the underlying cause of the incident and determining what went wrong.</p>
            <p>Lessons Learned: Documenting lessons learned from the incident and improving future responses.</p>
