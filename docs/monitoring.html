            <h3>Monitoring and Logging Overview</h3>
            <p>Comprehensive monitoring and logging strategies to detect, analyze, and respond to security incidents.</p>
            <div id="detail1" class="section-detail">
                <p>The Monitoring & Logging project was implemented to ensure continuous surveillance of the bank's IT infrastructure. It included the design, implementation, and management of monitoring systems that tracked network traffic, system health, and security events to enable proactive detection and response to potential security incidents.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Centralized Logging:</strong> Implementation of a centralized logging system to aggregate logs from various systems, servers, and network devices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Real-time Monitoring:</strong> 24/7 monitoring to detect unusual activities and provide quick responses to potential threats.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident Detection:</strong> Setup of automated alerting systems to notify security teams of potential incidents like unauthorized access or data breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance Tracking:</strong> Ensuring the logging practices comply with industry regulations like GDPR and ISO/IEC 27001.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The project ensured that the bank had full visibility over its network and security posture, helping prevent and detect threats in real-time.</p>

            <h3>Incident Response and Investigation</h3>
            <p>Key activities in detecting and responding to security incidents, supported by detailed logs and alerts.</p>
            <div id="detail2" class="section-detail">
                <p>Our monitoring system was integrated with the incident response framework to ensure immediate investigation and resolution of any detected anomalies. This involved:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Alerting Mechanism:</strong> Automated alerts generated by the logging system were sent to the Security Operations Center (SOC) for investigation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Log Correlation:</strong> Correlating logs from different sources to identify attack patterns or security breaches.</li>
                    <li><strong>Forensic Investigation:</strong> Conducting forensic analysis to understand the scope of any detected incidents.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident Documentation:</strong> Maintaining thorough documentation for every incident, including actions taken and lessons learned.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This allowed the team to quickly respond to potential security threats, reducing risk and minimizing the impact on operations.</p>

            <div id="detail3" class="section-detail">
                <p>The project involved the creation of reports for both internal stakeholders and external auditors. This reporting system provided detailed insights into the health of the bank’s IT infrastructure and security measures. Activities included:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Audit Trails:</strong> Ensuring logs are maintained securely and are available for auditing at any time.</li>
                    <li><strong>Compliance Reports:</strong> Generating reports to demonstrate adherence to industry standards like ISO/IEC 27001, GDPR, and other regulatory frameworks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Reviews:</strong> Ensuring the logs were reviewed periodically to identify vulnerabilities and risks.</li>
                    <li><strong>Evidence of Risk Mitigation:</strong> Reports detailing how security incidents were managed and mitigated.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These reports were essential for maintaining the trust of regulators and customers while demonstrating the bank's commitment to robust security practices.</p>
