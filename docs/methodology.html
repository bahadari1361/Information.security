        <h2>3. Methodology</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                During my tenure at the Central Bank of Afghanistan, I developed and implemented a structured methodology for conducting Information Security Assessments. The methodology involved identifying security gaps, ensuring compliance with industry standards, and assessing the effectiveness of the Information Security Management System (ISMS). The process combined document reviews, stakeholder interviews, technical vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing. It provided a holistic assessment of the Bank’s cybersecurity posture and guided improvements to enhance security defenses.

        </div>

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Key Phases in the Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Document Review</strong>: I began by reviewing critical documents, including security policies, risk management frameworks, and business continuity plans, to establish a baseline understanding of the Bank’s security posture.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews</strong>: I conducted interviews with key security personnel and department heads to gather insights into current security practices and identify areas of concern from a practical perspective.</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning</strong>: Using tools such as Nessus, Nmap, and Acunetix, I conducted detailed vulnerability assessments on the Bank’s network infrastructure and web applications to identify potential security gaps.</li>
                <li><strong>Penetration Testing</strong>: I led simulated penetration tests, employing controlled cyber-attacks to assess the effectiveness of existing security controls and incident response capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance Evaluation</strong>: As part of the final phase, I performed a gap analysis to evaluate the organization’s adherence to ISO/IEC 27001 standards, identifying areas that required remediation for full compliance.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="tools">
        <h2>Tools & Technologies Utilized</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>During the assessment, I leveraged the following tools and technologies to ensure a thorough evaluation:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kali Linux</strong>: Used for penetration testing, vulnerability exploitation, and ethical hacking exercises to uncover weaknesses in the system.</li>
                <li><strong>Nessus</strong>: I used Nessus for network vulnerability scanning, identifying critical misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the Bank’s network infrastructure.</li>
                <li><strong>Nmap</strong>: This network scanning tool helped me map the network topology, identify active devices, and discover open ports and services.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireshark</strong>: Employed for monitoring network traffic to detect anomalies, performance issues, or potential security incidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Acunetix</strong>: This web application security scanner was critical in identifying security weaknesses within the Bank’s online services, such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>ntopng</strong>: I utilized ntopng for real-time network monitoring, helping to detect unusual traffic patterns or potential security breaches across the Bank’s network.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </section>

    <section id="iso-27001">
        <h2>ISO 27001 Framework</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The entire assessment was conducted in alignment with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, which sets the criteria for establishing, operating, and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). Key areas that I focused on include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Security Governance and Risk Management</strong>: I ensured the Bank had robust governance structures in place to oversee security policies, conduct risk assessments, and mitigate identified risks effectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control</strong>: I assessed the access control mechanisms in place, ensuring that only authorized personnel had access to critical systems, following the principle of least privilege.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response and Management</strong>: I reviewed the Bank’s incident response procedures, ensuring that effective strategies were in place to detect, report, and resolve security incidents swiftly and in compliance with regulatory requirements.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Operations and Monitoring</strong>: I evaluated the effectiveness of security monitoring tools and the overall security operations, ensuring that the organization had sufficient visibility and response capabilities for emerging threats.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</strong>: The assessment included a detailed review of the Bank’s business continuity plans and disaster recovery strategies, verifying that the Bank could effectively respond to disasters and maintain critical operations in case of cyber incidents.</li>
            </ul>
