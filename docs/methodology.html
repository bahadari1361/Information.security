            <h3>Approach</h3>
            <p>
                The methodology utilized for this Information Security Assessment adheres to a comprehensive and structured approach designed to identify security vulnerabilities, evaluate compliance with industry standards, and assess the effectiveness of the existing Information Security Management System (ISMS). The process includes a combination of document review, stakeholder interviews, vulnerability scanning, penetration testing (where applicable), and compliance evaluation. This methodology ensures a holistic evaluation of the Central Bank of Afghanistan’s information security posture.

        <div class="content">
            <h3>Key Phases in the Methodology</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Document Review</strong>: The first phase of the assessment involves a thorough review of the organization’s existing documentation, including security policies, procedures, business continuity plans, incident response protocols, and risk management strategies.</li>
                <li><strong>Stakeholder Interviews</strong>: Interviews are conducted with key personnel across various departments to understand the implementation of security measures and evaluate security awareness.</li>
                <li><strong>Vulnerability Scanning</strong>: Technical vulnerability assessments are performed using industry-standard tools such as Nessus, Nmap, and Acunetix to scan for network vulnerabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Penetration Testing</strong>: Controlled penetration testing is carried out to simulate potential cyber-attacks and evaluate the resilience of security controls.</li>
                <li><strong>Compliance Evaluation</strong>: A gap analysis is conducted to evaluate the institution's compliance with ISO/IEC 27001 standards and identify areas requiring corrective actions.</li>
            </ul>

    <section id="tools">
        <h2>Tools & Technologies Utilized</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The following tools were employed during the assessment process:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Kali Linux</strong>: Used for penetration testing, ethical hacking, and vulnerability exploitation simulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Nessus</strong>: A network vulnerability scanning tool for identifying vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and weaknesses.</li>
                <li><strong>Nmap</strong>: A network scanning tool used to assess network topology, discover active devices, and identify open ports and services.</li>
                <li><strong>Wireshark</strong>: A protocol analyzer used for monitoring and analyzing network traffic to detect unusual patterns or security incidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Acunetix</strong>: A web application security scanner that identifies vulnerabilities within web applications.</li>
                <li><strong>ntopng</strong>: A real-time network monitoring tool used for monitoring network performance and security issues.</li>
            </ul>

    <section id="iso-27001">
        <h2>ISO 27001 Framework</h2>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The assessment was conducted in accordance with the ISO/IEC 27001 standard, which defines the criteria for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring, reviewing, and improving an Information Security Management System (ISMS). The following key areas were specifically examined:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Information Security Governance and Risk Management</strong>: Ensuring effective governance and risk management practices to protect information assets.</li>
                <li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Evaluating access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized personnel have access to critical systems and data.</li>
                <li><strong>Incident Response and Management</strong>: Assessing the organization’s ability to detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Operations and Monitoring</strong>: Reviewing the effectiveness of security monitoring tools and the security operations center (SOC), if applicable.</li>
                <li><strong>Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</strong>: Reviewing business continuity plans (BCPs) and disaster recovery strategies to ensure the organization can recover from potential incidents.</li>
            </ul>
